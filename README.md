<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Expense Tracking

Expense tracking is something that we all know we should be doing, but unfortunately not enough of us are. The benefits of tracking one's daily expenses are evident &ndash; for financial planning and literacy, as well as the cultivation of responsible spending habits. 

While I have been recording my expenses on a daily basis for the past 6 years, I must admit that it required a lot of discipline and it was definitely not easy to keep at it consistently, especially at the start. Tracking one's expenses sounds easy, but can actually be a **time-consuming** process that may require a fair bit of cognitive load to calculate and enter each expense correctly.

Therefore, I created this Telegram bot as a personal project to further automate the process of expense tracking, and to hopefully alleviate some of the pain of doing so. 

### Why a Telegram Bot?

The obvious idea would be a standalone app, but for reasons mentioned above, plus the fact that there are already many professionally created apps out there, I doubt I'd be able to value-add much in that space.

Telegram is a versatile messaging app that's ubiquitous among my social circle (and indeed, many Singaporeans out there). Thus, instead of yet another nameless app that I'm not going to remember using, why not leverage a platform that I use most frequently? Since we already have a deeply-ingrained habit of using Telegram on a daily &ndash; sometimes hourly &ndash; basis, I want to use this to leapfrog some of the inertia. 

On a side note, Telegram, being largely open-source, has well-established developer tools which alleviates the burden of frontend development and allows me to focus wholly on functionality, so that's a big W :D

### How is this different from a regular app?

Typical expense tracking apps require one to manually insert expense details into specified fields (e.g. amount spent, category, etc.), thereby placing the mental load on the user... just not very smart in general.

Thus, I designed this bot to act as a smart "assistant" &ndash; the user just needs to enter their expense in plain text, and the relevant details will be parsed automatically. This is possible due to the semantic understanding and natural language inference capabilities of LLMs (for example: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`). Therefore, by leveraging LLMs, the previously difficult task of creating a versatile expense tracking assistant has now become much easier.

<br/>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/demo_ss1.png" width="450" height="240"/><br>
  <sub>Screenshot of an expense recording instance. The model is able to parse the category correctly, although it is possible to make changes if need be (for example, if you want <code>Supermarket</code> as a category instead of <code>Groceries</code>).</sub>
</div>

### Agentic Workflow

The key feature of my bot is the ability for a user to leverage an AI agent for dynamic querying of their expenses, enabling smarter insights and even useful advice to improve one's spending habits.

To do so, I utilised LangGraph to create an agentic workflow for this analytics task. My LLMs of choice for this agent were `gpt-4.1-nano` and `gpt-5-mini` due to general performance, latency, and costs relative to other options out there. While the `gemini` suite of models is great, the low rate limit of 5 RPM was simply insufficient for agentic workflows, where multiple LLM calls have to be made in quick succession.

<br/>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/workflow_graph.png" width="200" height="538"/><br>
  <sub>Visualisation of the agentic workflow.</sub>
</div>

<br/>

Upon receiving a query from the user, the agent first decides if the question warrants querying of the `expenses` database to get an answer. If the question can be answered by a direct response, the process is routed straight to the `answer_query` node. 

```python
Example: {'user_query': 'Please give me some general tips on managing spending habits.'}
```

<br/>

Conversely, if the query requires more in-depth analysis of the user's expenses, the process will be routed to the `query_gen` state, where the agent will generate a SQL query to extract the relevant data. This generated query gets passed into the `correct_query` state, where an LLM is invoked to detect any potential errors (e.g. syntax), and make changes if necessary. In the `execute_query` state, a database query tool is called. If an error occurs, the error is surfaced to the agent and the `query_gen` cycle repeats. Otherwise, the output from the query is passed to the `answer_query` state for formulation of the final answer.

```python
Example: {'user_query': 'Please summarize my expenditure for this month.'}
```

<br/>

### ... What's Next?

While I've successfully built the bot's basic functions and it works as it should, it's far from perfect. There's no real end goal to this pet project of mine, and I fully intend to keep iterating and adding features/ QoL improvements to enhance the process as a whole. 

Some features in the pipeline include:

- **[DONE]** Implementing persistence in the bot (i.e. memory) which will allow the bot to remember conversation states upon prolonged inactivity (during which the Cloud Run instance may shut down). 
- Storing user preferences &ndash; this links back to persistence as well. I want to allow users to indicate their preferred currencies and expense categories (e.g. some users may prefer "Food and Drink", while others may want to store "Food" and "Drink" expenses under separate categories).
- Automatically generating a detailed monthly expense report with visualisations (graphs, charts, etc.) included. 

Stay tuned for more updates! 🎯

## Personal Thoughts

This is a project of many firsts. It's my first time doing dev stuff, working with LLMs, agents, deployment, the cloud, and even async programming. Despite the minimal front-end workload in terms of UI development, having to learn the Telegram Bot API framework from scratch more than made up for it, in my opinion. 

It has been a great experience stepping out of my comfort zone, and I relished the challenge of learning so many new tools and frameworks to get this thing to work. As this is a project that I have personal stake in (as I will actually be using this to track my daily expenses), I'm extremely motivated to give it my best shot, and to make a product worth using. 

I know it's not perfect &ndash; there are definitely loads of things I can improve. However, I do think it's exciting having an imperfect product with room to grow. I'll definitely keep thinking of ways to improve this bot, and by doing so, improve myself as well. 💪

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

As this is my first foray into working with LLMs and dev work, any contributions are greatly appreciated.

If you have a suggestion to improve the bot, be it functionality or even best practice advice, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

<br/>

**Caveat:** I am going to be extremely busy with my 9-5, so unfortunately new features in the pipeline may not materialise anytime soon. I do love working on this project (as I'm using it on a daily basis), and will definitely work on implementing new features whenever I can.

Also, while my bot is currently up and running, testing will only be open to a bunch of close friends as the cost of running this bot is entirely out of pocket 😔 However, I implore you to set the bot up for yourself (first-time Google Cloud users get a bunch of free credits anyway) and give it a try! 🚀
